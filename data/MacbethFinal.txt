ACT 0 SCENE 1. A desert place.
FIRST_WITCH#SYDNEY SECOND_WITCH#JORDAN THIRD_WITCH#LIZZIE MACBETH#DAN BANQUO#CHARLOTTE_ROSE ROSS#CHARLOTTE ANGUS#BELLA
FIRST WITCH
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH
When the hurly-burly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
FIRST WITCH
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH
Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
THIRD WITCH
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace, the charm's wound up.
MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO
What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question?
MACBETH
Speak, if you can: what are you?
FIRST WITCH
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be King hereafter!
BANQUO
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? â€”I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show?
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate.
FIRST WITCH
Hail!
SECOND WITCH
Hail!
THIRD WITCH
Hail!
FIRST WITCH
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
SECOND WITCH
Not so happy, yet much happier.
THIRD WITCH
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
FIRST WITCH
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence, or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
BANQUO
The earth has bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
MACBETH
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
BANQUO
Were such things here as we do speak about?
MACBETH
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO
You shall be King.
MACBETH
And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
BANQUO
To th' selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
ROSS
The king hath happily receiv'd, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his.
ANGUS
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks.
ROSS
And, for an earnest of a greater honor,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,
For it is thine.
BANQUO
What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH
The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?
ANGUS
Who was the Thane lives yet;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.
MACBETH
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind. Thanks for your pains.
BANQUO
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
MACBETH
Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme. -I thank you, gentlemen.
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings.
If chance will have me King, why, chance may crown me
Without my stir.
BANQUO
New honors come upon him,
Like strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.
MACBETH
Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
BANQUO
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH
Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
Think upon what hath chanc'd; and at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.
BANQUO
Very gladly.
MACBETH
Till then, enough. Come, friends.

ACT 0 SCENE 2. Forres. The palace.
DUNCAN#DALE MALCOLM#PAUL BANQUO#CHARLOTTE_ROSE MACBETH#SAM_B
DUNCAN
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?
MALCOLM
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die; who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons.
DUNCAN
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust. O worthiest cousin!
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserv'd, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.
BANQUO
There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.
DUNCAN
My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, Thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.
MACBETH
I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.
DUNCAN
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH
The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires,
Let not light see my black and deep desires.

ACT 0 SCENE 3. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.
LADY_MACBETH#CASEY MESSENGER#JORDAN MACBETH#SAM_B
LADY MACBETH
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
What thou art promised. yet do I fear thy nature,
It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way. Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
What is your tidings?
MESSENGER
The King comes here to-night.
LADY MACBETH
Thou'rt mad to say it!
Is not thy master with him? Who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.
MESSENGER
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH
Give him tending,
He brings great news. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe topful
Of direst cruelty! Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
MACBETH
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.
LADY MACBETH
And when goes hence?
MACBETH
To-morrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my Thane, is as a book, where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like th' innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch,
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH
Only look up clear:
To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.

ACT 0 SCENE 4. Before Macbeth's castle.
DUNCAN#DALE BANQUO#CHARLOTTE_ROSE LADY_MACBETH#LYDIA
DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself.
BANQUO
The air is delicate.
DUNCAN
Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.
LADY MACBETH
Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.
DUNCAN
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess.

ACT 0 SCENE 5. Macbeth's castle.
MACBETH#SAM_B LADY_MACBETH#LYDIA
MACBETH
If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly. If th' assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease, success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague th' inventor. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on th' other-
How now! what news?
LADY MACBETH
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
MACBETH
Hath he ask'd for me?
LADY MACBETH
Know you not he has?
MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business.
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.
LADY MACBETH
What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.
MACBETH
If we should fail?
LADY MACBETH
We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him -his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lies as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
Th' unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spungy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?
MACBETH
Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv'd,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and us'd their very daggers,
That they have done't?
LADY MACBETH
Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Upon his death?
MACBETH
I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

ACT 0 SCENE 6. Court of Macbeth's castle.
BANQUO#CHARLOTTE_ROSE FLEANCE#CHARLOTTE MACBETH#SAM_GW
BANQUO
How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
BANQUO
And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE
I take't, 'tis later, sir.
BANQUO
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
MACBETH
A friend.
BANQUO
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.
MACBETH
I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.
BANQUO
At your kind'st leisure.
I shall be counsell'd.
MACBETH
Good repose the while!
BANQUO
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
MACBETH
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

ACT 0 SCENE 7. The same.
LADY_MACBETH#DINAH MACBETH#SAM_GW
LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!
MACBETH
Who's there? what, ho!
LADY MACBETH
Alack, I am afraid they have awak'd,
And 'tis not done. I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
My husband!
MACBETH
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
MACBETH
When?
LADY MACBETH
Now.
MACBETH
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH
Ay.
MACBETH
Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?
LADY MACBETH
Donalbain.
MACBETH
This is a sorry sight.
LADY MACBETH
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
List'ning their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'
LADY MACBETH
Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
Stuck in my throat.
LADY MACBETH
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
MACBETH
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep'
LADY MACBETH
What do you mean?
MACBETH
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
LADY MACBETH
Who was it that thus cried? Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.
MACBETH
I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.
LADY MACBETH
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.
MACBETH
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand?
LADY MACBETH
My hands are of your color; but I shame
To wear a heart so white. I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then! Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.
MACBETH
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

ACT 0 SCENE 8. The same.
PORTER#DAN MACDUFF#SOPHIA LENNOX#CASEY MACBETH#SAM_GW LADY_MACBETH#LIZZY DONALBAIN#SYDNEY MALCOLM#PAUL BANQUO#DEMETRIO
PORTER
Here's a knocking indeed!
Knock, knock, knock!
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there? Anon, anon!
MACDUFF
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?
PORTER
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.
MACDUFF
What three things does drink especially provoke?
PORTER
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
MACDUFF
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
PORTER
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie.
LENNOX
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH
Good morrow, both.
MACDUFF
Is the king stirring, worthy Thane?
MACBETH
Not yet.
MACDUFF
He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.
MACBETH
I'll bring you to him.
This is the door.
MACDUFF
I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.
LENNOX
Goes the king hence to-day?
MACBETH
He does: he did appoint so.
LENNOX
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death.
MACBETH
'Twas a rough night.
MACDUFF
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
LADY MACBETH
What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
MACDUFF
O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master's murder'd!
LADY MACBETH
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
BANQUO
Too cruel any where.
MACBETH
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.
DONALBAIN
What is amiss?
MACBETH
You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
MACDUFF
Your royal father 's murder'd.
MALCOLM
O, by whom?
LENNOX
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood.
MACBETH
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.
MACDUFF
Wherefore did you so?
MACBETH
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love known?
LADY MACBETH
Help me hence, ho!
BANQUO
Look to the lady.
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work.
MACBETH
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.
MACDUFF AND LENNOX AND BANQUO
Well contented.
MALCOLM
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
DONALBAIN
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles.
MALCOLM
Therefore, to horse;
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

ACT 0 SCENE 9. Outside Macbeth's castle.
ROSS#CHARLOTTE MACDUFF#SOPHIA
ROSS
Macduff, how goes the world, sir, now?
MACDUFF
Why, see you not?
ROSS
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDUFF
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.
ROSS
Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
MACDUFF
He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.
ROSS
Will you to Scone?
MACDUFF
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS
Well, I will thither.
MACDUFF
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ACT 0 SCENE 10. Forres. The palace.
BANQUO#DEMETRIO MACBETH#DALE ATTENDANT#DAN FIRST_MURDERER#SAM_B SECOND_MURDERER#SAM_GW
BANQUO
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't. But hush! no more.
MACBETH
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
And I'll request your presence.
BANQUO
Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.
MACBETH
Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
Is't far you ride?
BANQUO
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper.
MACBETH
Fail not our feast.
BANQUO
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH
Goes Fleance with you?
BANQUO
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
Farewell.
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
Our pleasure?
ATTENDANT
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH
Bring them before us.
Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Who's there!
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
FIRST MURDERER AND SECOND MURDERER
It was, so please your Highness.
MACBETH
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.
FIRST MURDERER AND SECOND MURDERER
True, my lord.
FIRST MURDERER
We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.
SECOND MURDERER
Though our lives-
MACBETH
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And leave no rubs nor botches in the work-
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.
FIRST MURDERER AND SECOND MURDERER
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

ACT 0 SCENE 11. The palace.
LADY_MACBETH#LIZZY MACBETH#ALEX
LADY MACBETH
How now, my lord! Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.
MACBETH
We have scorch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
LADY MACBETH
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
MACBETH
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
LADY MACBETH
What's to be done?
MACBETH
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day.

ACT 0 SCENE 12. A park near the palace.
FIRST_MURDERER#SAM_B SECOND_MURDERER#LIZZY THIRD_MURDERER#ALEX BANQUO#DEMETRIO
FIRST MURDERER
But who did bid thee join with us?
SECOND MURDERER
Macbeth.
THIRD MURDERER
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
FIRST MURDERER
Then stand with us.
SECOND MURDERER
Hark! I hear horses.
BANQUO
Give us a light there, ho!
THIRD MURDERER
Then 'tis he.
FIRST MURDERER
His horses go about.
SECOND MURDERER
Almost a mile: but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.
THIRD MURDERER
A light, a light!
FIRST MURDERER
'Tis he.
SECOND MURDERER
Stand to't.
BANQUO
It will be rain to-night.
THIRD MURDERER
Let it come down.
BANQUO
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
FIRST MURDERER
Who did strike out the light?
SECOND MURDERER
Wast not the way?
THIRD MURDERER
There's but one down; the son is fled.
FIRST MURDERER
We have lost
Best half of our affair.
SECOND MURDERER
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

ACT 0 SCENE 13. The same. Hall in the palace.
MACBETH#EVERETT LADY_MACBETH#ZOE FIRST_MURDERER#SAM_B ROSS#CHARLOTTE LENNOX#CASEY ANGUS#BELLA
MACBETH
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.
ROSS AND LENNOX AND ANGUS
Thanks to your majesty.
MACBETH
Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
LADY MACBETH
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
MACBETH
There's blood upon thy face.
FIRST MURDERER
'Tis Banquo's then.
MACBETH
Is he dispatch'd?
FIRST MURDERER
My lord, his throat is cut;
That I did for him.
MACBETH
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats.
FIRST MURDERER
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.
MACBETH
Then comes my fit again. Get thee gone: to-morrow
We'll hear, ourselves, again.
LADY MACBETH
My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer.
MACBETH
Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!
LENNOX
May't please your highness sit.
ROSS
Please't your highness
To grace us with your royal company?
MACBETH
The table's full.
LENNOX
Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH
Where?
LENNOX
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?
MACBETH
Which of you have done this?
ROSS AND LENNOX AND ANGUS
What, my good lord?
MACBETH
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.
ROSS
Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.
LADY MACBETH
Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
MACBETH
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appall the devil.
LADY MACBETH
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
You look but on a stool.
MACBETH
Prithee, see there!
behold! look! lo! how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
LADY MACBETH
What, quite unmann'd in folly?
MACBETH
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH
Fie, for shame!
Your noble friends do lack you.
MACBETH
I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.
ROSS AND LENNOX AND ANGUS
Our duties, and the pledge.
MACBETH
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Unreal mockery, hence!
Why, so: being gone,
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
LADY MACBETH
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.
MACBETH
Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder?
ROSS
What sights, my lord?
LADY MACBETH
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
At once, good night.
LENNOX
Good night; and better health
Attend his majesty!
LADY MACBETH
A kind good night to all!
MACBETH
It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?
LADY MACBETH
Did you send to him, sir?
MACBETH
I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. I am in blood
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
LADY MACBETH
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
MACBETH
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.

FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
FIRST WITCH
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.
SECOND WITCH
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
THIRD WITCH
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!
MACBETH
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
A deed without a name.
MACBETH
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
To what I ask you.
FIRST WITCH
Speak.
SECOND WITCH
Demand.
THIRD WITCH
We'll answer.
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!
FIRST APPARITION
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
MACBETH
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one word more,-
FIRST WITCH
He will not be commanded: here's another,
More potent than the first.
SECOND APPARITION
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
MACBETH
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
SECOND APPARITION
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.
MACBETH
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live.
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king?
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
Listen, but speak not to't.
THIRD APPARITION
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.
MACBETH
That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?
FIRST WITCH AND SECOND WITCH AND THIRD WITCH
Seek to know no more.
MACBETH
I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
LENNOX
Macduff is fled to England.
MACBETH
Fled to England!
LENNOX
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.

LADY MACDUFF
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
ROSS
You must have patience, madam.
LADY MACDUFF
He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.
ROSS
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
LADY MACDUFF
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not.
ROSS
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further.
LADY MACDUFF
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.
LADY MACDUFF
Sirrah, your father's dead;
And what will you do now? How will you live?
SON
Was my father a traitor, mother?
LADY MACDUFF
Ay, that he was.
SON
What is a traitor?
LADY MACDUFF
Why, one that swears and lies.
SON
And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDUFF
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
SON
Who must hang them?
LADY MACDUFF
Why, the honest men.
SON
Then the liars and swearers are fools,
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them.
MESSENGER
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
LADY MACDUFF
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly.
What are these faces?
FIRST MURDERER
Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.
SECOND MURDERER
He's a traitor.
SON
Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!
THIRD MURDERER
What, you egg!
Young fry of treachery!
SON
He has kill'd me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!

ACT 0 SCENE 16. England. Before the King's palace.
MALCOLM#PAUL MACDUFF#ZOE ROSS#CHARLOTTE
MALCOLM
Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom.
MALCOLM
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
He hath not touch'd you yet.
MACDUFF
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM
But Macbeth is.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds.
MACDUFF
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
In evils to top Macbeth. O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me!
MACDUFF
Ross, stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS
Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile.
MACDUFF
O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!
MALCOLM
What's the newest grief?
ROSS
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one. But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.
MACDUFF
If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.
MACDUFF
Hum! I guess at it.
ROSS
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
To add the death of you.
MALCOLM
Merciful heaven!
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
MACDUFF
My children too?
ROSS
Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.
MACDUFF
And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?
ROSS
I have said.
MALCOLM
Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.
MACDUFF
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?
MALCOLM
Dispute it like a man.
MACDUFF
I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man.
MALCOLM
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
MACDUFF
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too!
MALCOLM
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.

DOCTOR#JORDAN GENTLEWOMAN#BELLA LADY_MACBETH#SOPHIA
DOCTOR
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
GENTLEWOMAN
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
DOCTOR
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
GENTLEWOMAN
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands:
I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
LADY MACBETH
Yet here's a spot. Out, damned spot! out, I say!
Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to accompt?
-Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.
DOCTOR
Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH
The Thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?-
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
-No more o'that, my lord, no more o' that:
you mar all with this starting.
DOCTOR
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
GENTLEWOMAN
She has spoke what she should not.
LADY MACBETH
Here's the smell of the blood still:
all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, oh, oh!
DOCTOR
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
This disease is beyond my practise.
LADY MACBETH
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.
-I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried;
he cannot come out on's grave.
DOCTOR
Even so?
LADY MACBETH
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
done cannot be undone. -To bed, to bed, to bed!
DOCTOR
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.
GENTLEWOMAN
Good night, good doctor.

ACT 0 SCENE 18. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.
MACBETH#LIZZIE SERVANT#BELLA SEYTON#EVERETT DOCTOR#JORDAN
MACBETH
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all.
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounc'd me thus:
"Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false Thanes.
SERVANT
There is ten thousand-
MACBETH
Geese, villain!
SERVANT
Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
SERVANT
The English force, so please you.
MACBETH
Take thy face hence. Seyton, What news more?
SEYTON
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?
DOCTOR
Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.
MACBETH
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?
DOCTOR
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.
MACBETH
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

ACT 0 SCENE 19. Country near Birnam wood.
MALCOLM#ALEX MENTEITH#JORDAN SIWARD#BELLA
MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH
We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH
The wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.
SOLDIERS
It shall be done.

ACT 0 SCENE 20. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
MACBETH#DEMETRIO SEYTON#EVERETT MESSENGER#DINAH
MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
And beat them backward home.
What is that noise?
SEYTON
The queen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH
She should have died hereafter;
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
MESSENGER
Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do't.
MACBETH
Well, say, sir.
MESSENGER
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The wood began to move.
MACBETH
Liar and slave!
MESSENGER
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.
MACBETH
If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee. 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.

ACT 0 SCENE 21. Dunsinane. Before the castle.
MALCOLM#ALEX SIWARD#BELLA MACDUFF#SYDNEY
MALCOLM
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.
SIWARD
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
MACDUFF
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

ACT 0 SCENE 22. Another part of the field.
MACBETH#LYDIA YOUNG_SIWARD#CHARLOTTE_ROSE MACDUFF#SYDNEY MALCOLM#ALEX
MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name?
MACBETH
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOUNG SIWARD
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.
MACBETH
My name's Macbeth.
YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.
MACBETH
No, nor more fearful.
YOUNG SIWARD
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
MACBETH
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
MACDUFF
Turn, hell-hound, turn!
MACBETH
Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.
MACDUFF
I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!
MACBETH
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
To one of woman born.
MACDUFF
Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripp'd.
MACBETH
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
I'll not fight with thee.
MACDUFF
Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
'Here may you see the tyrant.'
MACBETH
I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Lay on, Macduff,
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
MACDUFF
Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free.
Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL
Hail, King of Scotland!
MALCOLM
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honor named. What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
